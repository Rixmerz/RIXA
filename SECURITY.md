# Security Policy

Please avoid reporting vulnerabilities in public issues.

Report privately via:
- GitHub Security Advisories (Security tab → Report a vulnerability), or
- Email: juanpablo516@gmail.com

We aim to acknowledge within 72 hours and share a remediation timeline ASAP.

## Supported versions

We support the latest minor release line; older versions may receive best‑effort fixes only.
